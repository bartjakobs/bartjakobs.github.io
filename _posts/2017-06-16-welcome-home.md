In 2014, I participated in the Dutch Open hackathon with a [team of 4].
Using the API's of Bol.com, Albert Heijn, Schiphol, KLM and MyOrder, we created the winning concept in the biggest hackathon in the Netherlands: the app Welcome Home.

### Welcome home?
The worst part of coming back from vacation is coming home to an empty fridge.
Welcome Home is a service that allows you to order a box full of fresh food, delivering it right to the baggage carousel at the airport.

### Role
We participated in a team of four: two designers and two developers.
We had 24 hours to make a concept and prototype. As one of the developers, I wrote some API connections and a small front-end app framework.
We won yay.
