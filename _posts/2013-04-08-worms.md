At the TU/e, there was this 'tokenborrel', a yearly event where the drinks ordered were registered with a token.
On a big screen, a game was displayed on which the drinking per study year was visualized.
In 2013, I was asked to make a game with some other students.
We decided to make Worms. [Daan] made the graphics, [Jochem] made a backend which decided who should win (who drank the most) and I made the game.
I did not feel like getting to know a game engine, so I wrote a new one.

### Big deal
Actually, yes big deal. It had some sort of physics engine, and afterwards I had a better understanding of mathematics, so that's something.

### Can I play it.
