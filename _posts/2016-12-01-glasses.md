This is one of my projects to make musical instruments.  I started with one servo motor and two glasses. The servo motor was attached to a pencil that moved between the glasses.

### And then?
I took for servo motors, made laser-cut stands, got an [Arduino], wrote a bunch of code in [NodeJS] and made music!

### Awesome! How does it work?
Using metal wire, a pencil is attached to a servo motor. A servo motor can be controlled by transmitting an angle to it.
The computer sends the angles via the Arduino (using [Firmata]).
The NodeJS application on the computer has a midi reader, so that music can be read and translated to the right angles on the right servo motors.

### Cool! Can I see it?
Alright then.
